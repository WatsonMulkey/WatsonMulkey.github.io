A poet once told me “Someone is always on their way to you.” I’m glad you’re finally here.

After 2+ awesome years at The Iron Yard, I'm currently scanning the horizon looking for my next move. If you're interested in talking about work, the time herded cattle in loafers, what's on my karaoke playlist, my thoughts about the oxford comma, or about how color is a finite resource; get in touch below. 

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/WatsonMulkey) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monomythism) or plain 'ole email: watsonmulkey@gmail.com.
