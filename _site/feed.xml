        <title>Book Notes Hooked By Nir Eyal</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;book-notes-hooked-how-to-build-habit-forming-products-by-nir-eyal&quot;&gt;Book Notes: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/&quot;&gt;Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-was-recently-given-a-task-to-power-through-some-books-for-both-personal-retention-and-public-good-i-thought-id-borrow-a-dance-move-from-derek-sivers-and-keep-public-notes-on-them-these-notes-will-be-updated-when-i-push-to-the-blog-and-will-follow-along-with-me-in-the-book-when-i-finish-a-book-ill-try-and-do-some-big-takeaways&quot;&gt;I was recently given a task to power through some books. For both personal retention and public good, I thought I‚Äôd borrow a dance move from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt; and keep public notes on them. These notes will be updated when I push to the blog and will follow along with me in the book. When I finish a book, I‚Äôll try and do some big takeaways.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;amassing-millions-of-users-is-no-longer-enough-companies-increasingly-find-that-their-economic-value-is-a-function-of-the-strength-of-the-habits-they-create-pg-2&quot;&gt;‚ÄúAmassing millions of users is no longer enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create.‚Äù pg 2&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caught my eye, but I‚Äôm up in the air about the universality of it at this point. This might be more true for companies that take percentages (ride sharing, transactions) than companies who survive on ad revenue (Facebook, Twitter). Google seems to the be an exception. Happy to be prove wrong about that (which, presumably is what this book will do.) &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn‚Äôt drive you to keep opening it again and again.‚Äù Pg 8&lt;/h5&gt;

Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating parts associated with wanting and desire.‚Äù pg 8-9&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. The ‚Äúloot box‚Äù phenomenon that‚Äôs being integrated into all aspects of games makes a lot of sense given this research. This might also be why games RPG‚Äôs are so compelling in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cracked.com/article_18461_5-creepy-ways-video-games-are-trying-to-get-you-addicted.html&quot;&gt;Here‚Äôs an article from Cracked about this specifically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt help but think of this in terms of software that allow for short cutting workflows in favor of efficiency. I still reach for my Alfred snippets, and remember my Front workflows quite well. It seems like software used to create habit by simplifying process is perhaps trying to do the same thing. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For books about WOMM, I‚Äôd recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fizz-Harness-Power-Marketing-Growth/dp/0071835741/&quot;&gt;Fizz by Ted Wright&lt;/a&gt; and checking out Ted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TedWrightMedia&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ie; does this solve a problem, or does it satisfy you in some other way. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.‚Äù pg. 48&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YEP. This reminds of me of something Jason Pargin (aka Cracked‚Äôs David Wong) talks about on a couple of episodes of the Cracked podcast. How social apps are altering our brain chemistry to receive little dopamine hits from apps. The idea of these boredom triggers cycling into dopamine drops from the app use cements the process even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard the idea from Tim Ferriss, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/480240/adventures-in-grayscale/&quot;&gt;here‚Äôs a video talking about how to break cell phone addiction&lt;/a&gt;, and one of many articles talking about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3042046/the-science-behind-how-boredom-benefits-creative-thought&quot;&gt;boredom can be a good thing.&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To do so, product designers must know their users internal triggers‚Äì‚Äìthat is, the pain they seek to solve‚Ä¶The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user‚Äôs pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company‚Äôs product or service as the source of relief.‚Äù pg. 51-52&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Lots of really good points about ‚Äúdeclared preferences‚Äù vs. ‚Äúrevealed preferences‚Äù. What people say they want vs. what they actually do. I imagine this is what a lot of the fitness tracking industry is banking on. They don‚Äôt necessarily care if people lose weight, they want to sell them the satisfaction of feeling like they‚Äôre actively working on their weight. I suppose in this way they‚Äôre ‚Äúvitamin‚Äù products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also ties into the idea of moral licensing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjf8b_LLZ6g&quot;&gt;(here‚Äôs Gladwell giving a topical example)&lt;/a&gt; and the idea that we justify bad behavior based on past good behavior. The idea being that a fitness band/tracker gives you lots of emotional triggers, AND helps you do the things you want to do (break a diet), while still providing you the comfort of licensing away bad behavior. Pretty compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Just got an alert from the Hearthstone app on my phone: ‚ÄúA new ranked play season has begun! See how far you can climb this month!‚Äù Quite timely.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Less Is More</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-trying-to-pair-down-a-bit&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm trying to pair down a bit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This most recent iteration of my apartment has a bit more square footage than I wanted and than I‚Äôm used to. My fear is that increased square footage means a heightened propensity to horde and collect. That‚Äôs an instinct that I‚Äôm genetically predisposed to, so the game is always trying to not add to the compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it‚Äôs increasingly looking like I‚Äôll be moving apartments, even if I stay in Greenville, I can‚Äôt help but cast a discerning eye over all the things that made the journey with me to this apartment in April. I like having books, but how many of them do I even lend out, let alone read. I like the framed pictures on mantle, but how would I present and keep them as memories as opposed to decoration? What would a small album that sat on a single table do for my appreciation for those photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I got rid of some clothes that I‚Äôd carried with me for the better part of a decade but had hardly ever worn. I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2017/04/16/marie-kondo/&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss podcast that featured featured Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt; that completely changed my thinking about holding on to sentimental items that have burdensome. The first was the idea that when things that were given to bring joy (for whatever reason) become a burden, then you‚Äôre not honoring the gift or the emotion that created it‚Äôs giving by holding on to it. The second was the idea of ‚Äúthanking‚Äù items before you get rid of them. Taking time to appreciate the items for what they did for you, helped me let go of them in a way that didn‚Äôt feel like I was throwing something away. I donated two giant bags full of clothes to goodwill, and I haven‚Äôt missed any of those things since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm closing in on two weeks of work left, and it‚Äôs clear that life is about to shift for me. Now seems as good a time as any to re-evaluate my relationship with the things in my life, and make sure that I‚Äôm giving space, time and attention to the items that really matter. My hope is that my removing the clutter I can magnify the impact of the things that are truly special and worth holding on to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Constant State Of Wip</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;ive-tried-to-be-very-aware-about-developing-bad-programming-habits&quot;&gt;I‚Äôve tried to be very aware about developing bad programming habits.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems like many arguments and disagreements about what constitutes ‚Äúbad‚Äù habits are more pedantic than practical, successful coding and development hinge on detail and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I‚Äôm a big fan of getting my hands dirty. In the low-stakes game of a personal Jekyll blog, I enjoy the constant git pushing and the changes. Messing up, figuring out why something is broken, and then going in and trying to fix it is part of the thrill of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a time for proper prior planning, and there‚Äôs a time for playing in the dirt. Therefore, forgive me these my many iterations‚Äì‚ÄìI promise they‚Äôre not a thinly veiled attempt at padding my commit history.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Into It Over It And Whether Propogation Always Equals Success</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Evan Thomas Weiss wrote and recorded a song a week for an entire year. The anthology known as ‚Äú52 Weeks‚Äù was an opening salvo for a career that (so far) has proven to be incredibly prolific, spanning multiple bands, labels, collaborators, while maintaining a sound a feel that feels native to it‚Äôs creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weiss has said in so many words and in as many interviews ‚ÄúIf you want to get good at music, you just have to write music.‚Äù It‚Äôs tempting to want to heed Weiss‚Äô advice, but is the path to notoriety, re tweets, mentions (or whichever trappings of success one acknowledges) found simply through proliferation, or are the geniuses of music and the unicorns of business guilty of being romanticized by the same survivorship bias?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In world that increasingly asks for our attention, is propagating the idea that effort expended always corresponds neatly and consistently the measurable progress seems unfordable. As we continue to luxuriously drown in new content that spans all mediums, does the content that we create to better our craft become a detriment to others?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Glad You're Here</title>
        <description>If you manage to find your way here while this post is still up, you're either a friend, curious, bored, or (depending on your outlook on life) lucky. 

I'm planning on making this a space where I get by with myself, and with a little help with my friends.
