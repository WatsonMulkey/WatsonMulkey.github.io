### Book Notes: [The Power of a Positive No by William Ury](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Positive-No-Relationship-Still/dp/0553384260/)

• He's capitalizing the "N" in every instance of "No". Small thing, but just a couple of pages in, it's already becoming mantra like. I like it. 

##### "Like all good Nos, ours were in service of a higher Yes..." pg. 2

##### "As long time British Prime Minister Tony Blair put it, "The art of leadership is not saying Yes, it's saying No." Pg. 4

Love that quote. </>

• I'm barely past the introduction, but I'm already imagining how I'm going to start viewing the personal value of saying "No". Some of the smartest people I know are more interested in learning than they are in appearing to know everything. They'll plainly state "I'm sorry I'm not familiar with that." or "I don't what that is, could you please explain more.", which accomplishes two goals. 

Firstly, they actually learn about new things instead of trying to piece things together with context clues (which they're perfectly capable of doing). Secondly, when they do chime in, I assume that they actually know what they're talking about and have done research on a subject. 

Their lack of fear and concern about asking questions gives greater credence to their comments elsewhere. 

I'm already thinking about "No's" in the same terms. If you say no when you can't or don't want to, it gives greater value to the times you say "yes".
