### Time your Jump

It's been a little over a month and half since I started my new Product Management job, and I think the best analogy for starting as a PM in a new job (especially one with as many moving parts as Helix) is that it's like double dutch. 

What at first appears to be a confusing swirl of ropes is actually a coordinated and repeating pattern.  While the temptation to jump right in and be a part of whats happening is strong, doing so before you've had the time to analyze the patterns will completely disrupt not only the people who are swinging the ropes, but all the peopel who are already in the middle and jumping. 

Though there have been plenty of times when I've wanted to jump in, and have been compelled by my personality to base nature to try and be as helpful as possible as quickly as possible, I've forced myself to try and hang back and watch the ropes swing. 

Earnestness is only valuable and admirable if it doesn't comprise the object of it's focus. So take your time, study the pattern, ask lots of questions, so that when you do jump in, you can break 'em off.
