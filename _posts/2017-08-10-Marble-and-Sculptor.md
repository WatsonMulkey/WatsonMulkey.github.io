### Marble / Sculptor 

For most of my life I’ve been fairly unhealthy. The desire to get my health sorted out came about when I got to a point in my life where I wasn’t happy with my circumstances and decided to do something about it. I’ve found that pinterest styled quotes about adversity creating opportunities for growth always have a way of feeling trite and unwanted.

“Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” 

“If it doesn’t challenge you, it won’t change you.”

“Tough times make tough people.”
 
But I’ve realized that as trite yet abrupt at these phrases seem to be when they jump out of your timeline; they’re pretty much correct. No growth comes from comfort. Comfort is warm stagnation. 

My mantra for the last couple of years has been a quote that I’ve seen attributed to the Nobel Prize winning Surgeon, [Alexis Carrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Carrel): 

“Man can not remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor.” 

These last few weeks (and presumably these next few months ) will be tough. They’re times of emotional and possibly physical upheaval. While there’s some comfort in the inevitability of what’s happening, there’s a simultaneous desire to cling to the comforts that I have for as long as I can. To slip inch by inch into the water––lamenting it’s cold. It’s hard to remember that the best way to deal with the situation is to just jump in. To not only embrace the discomfort, but to *thank* the discomfort. 

All these things I know but am want to forget, resonate more clearly every time I slip with my diet, or miss the gym. The temptation to just have a slice of pizza, or the mental gymnastics I’ll perform to convince myself that an hour at the gym isn’t a good idea. When I told my friend Mike about what was happening with The Iron Yard, he made the point (correctly) that being diligent about the things I’ve come to rely on as a part of my daily routine are more important than ever, but the challenge is holding on to that truth that you know when everything else in your brain is running a counter narrative. 

When everything else is in near upheavel, being able to lean on diet and exercise as points of consistency is not only important, but a way to celebrate the progress that I’ve made in both areas. Discipline and health are the new ways I sing and celebrate myself ([👋 Walt Whitman](http://www.daypoems.net/poems/1900.html)), and to remember that a couple of years ago the idea of diet and exercise being tent poles instead of chores would have been wishful thinking at best.
