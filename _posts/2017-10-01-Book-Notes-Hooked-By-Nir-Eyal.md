### Book Notes: ![Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1506724423&sr=1-1&keywords=hooked)

# I was recently given a task to power through some books. For both personal retention and public good, I thought I'd borrow a dance move from ![Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/book) and keep public notes on them. These notes will be updated when I push to the blog and will follow along with me in the book. When I finish a book, I'll try and do some big takeaways.
