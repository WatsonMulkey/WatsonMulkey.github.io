### Book Notes: [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1506724423&sr=1-1&keywords=hooked)

#### I was recently given a task to power through some books. For both personal retention and public good, I thought I'd borrow a dance move from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/book) and keep public notes on them. These notes will be updated when I push to the blog and will follow along with me in the book. When I finish a book, I'll try and do some big takeaways.

##### "Amassing millions of users is no longer enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create." - page 2 

This caught my eye, but I'm up in the air about the universality of it at this point. This might be more true for companies that take percentages (ride sharing, transactions) than companies who survive on ad revenue (Facebook, Twitter). Google seems to the be an exception. Happy to be prove wrong about that (which, presumably is what this book will do.) </>

##### The Hook Model

Trigger (internal/ external), Action, Variable, Reward. </>

##### "Feedback Loops are all around us, but predictable ones don't create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn't drive you to keep opening it again and again. Page 8"

ðŸ¤” </>

##### "Research shows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward. Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating parts associated with wanting and desire. page 8-9" 

Wow. The "loot box" phenomenon that's being integrated into all aspects of games makes a lot of sense given this research. This might also be why games RPG's are so compelling in the first place. 

##### "Recently, a blog reader emailed me, "If it can't be used for evil, it's not a superpower. page 11"

Whoa. </>

##### "Habit forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. page 17"

I can't help but think of this in terms of software that allow for short cutting workflows in favor of efficiency. I still reach for my Alfred snippets, and remember my Front workflows quite well. It seems like software used to create habit by simplifying process is perhaps trying to do the same thing. </>

##### "A business is worth the sum of its future profits. -page 19"

For books about WOMM, I'd recommend [Fizz by Ted Wright](https://www.amazon.com/Fizz-Harness-Power-Marketing-Growth/dp/0071835741/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506872326&sr=8-1&keywords=fizz+book) and checking out Ted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TedWrightMedia). </>
